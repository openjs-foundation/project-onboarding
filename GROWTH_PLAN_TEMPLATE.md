# ${PROJECT} Growth Plan

_Note: the purpose of the growth plan is to provide a roadmap for a project to move from Growth stage to Impact stage._

## Growth stage requirements

_Note: in theory, Growth stage requirements should already be met by all Growth stage projects.
As requirements might have changed after a project was accepted at the Growth stage, this isn't necessarily always the case.
So making sure that all Growth requirements are met is a good first step in any Growth plan._
